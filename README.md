# script_runner
A script made in Bash that receives the name of a file and its path as parameters, and auto-detects what extension it is and with which interpreter it should be opened in a new terminal (in my case, LXTerminal).  This script supports Python, Bash, C, and C++, but you can edit it if you need support for another language.
